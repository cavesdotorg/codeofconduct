### Why have a code of conduct?

Our goal is to create the best community in the world for becoming a better caver. We want every member of the NSS community to be able to focus their attention on becoming a better caver, both at official NSS events and as part of our community. This is impossible to do if you are being harassed, stalked, or discriminated against. 

Accordingly, all NSS members, as well as guest and visitors, are expected to show respect and courtesy to each other in all interactions, whether at official NSS events, in our online community, or in other contexts.

To make sure that everyone has a common understanding of "show respect and courtesy to each other," we are requesting the NSS adopt the following code of conduct. The code of conduct is enforced by __________.


### Unacceptable behavior

The following types of behavior are unacceptable at official NSS events, both online and in-person, and constitute code of conduct violations. 


#### Abusive behavior

**Harassment— **including offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion, as well as sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual or romantic attention.

**Threats— **threatening someone physically or verbally. For example, threatening to publicize sensitive information about someone's personal life.


#### Unwelcoming behavior

**Blatant -isms— **saying things that are explicitly racist, sexist, homophobic, etc. For example, arguing that some people are less intelligent because of their gender, race or religion. Subtle -isms and small mistakes made in conversation are not code of conduct violations. However, repeating something after it has been pointed out to you that you broke a social rule, or antagonizing or arguing with someone who has pointed out your subtle -ism is considered unwelcoming behavior, and is not allowed in the NSS community.

**Maliciousness towards other cavers— **deliberately attempting to make others feel bad, name-calling, singling out others for derision or exclusion. For example, telling someone they're not a real caver or that they don't belong at the NSS.

**Being especially unpleasant— **for example, if we've received reports from multiple NSS members of annoying, rude, or especially distracting behavior.

While NSS is a professional community, it is also a community of friends. We ask you to be aware of the fact that conversations that may be appropriate within the context of a specific friendship or relationship with another NSS member may be inappropriate at an official NSS event or in a group conversation with NSS members you don't know well.


### Scope

NSS members are held to the standards outlined in the code of conduct when interacting at official NSS events, and online on NSS internal communities like the Cavechat.org, NSS Facebook Group, and NSS Slack. 

In addition, the NSS community and experience often extends outside official NSS events. NSS members go on caving trips together, attend meetups or conferences as a group, and communicate on social media. Abusive or unwelcoming behavior between NSS members still has a profound impact on individuals and on the community when it happens outside of official NSS events. _______ will use our discretion when deciding whether to enforce this code of conduct and potentially remove someone from the NSS community after reports of such behavior happening outside of official NSS events, taking into account the impact on the individual NSS members involved as well as the impact on the community at large.

When in doubt, please report abusive or unwelcoming behavior to us. If someone's behavior outside of official NSS events makes you feel unsafe at official NSS events, this is absolutely relevant and actionable for us.


### Enforcement

We have categorized unacceptable behavior into abuse and unwelcoming behavior in the section above.

If we witness or receive a report about abusive behavior, we will contact the perpetrator to have a conversation with them and verify what has transpired, and they will be removed from the RC community. They will be removed as a NSS member, and they will not be welcome at official NSS events.

If we witness or receive a report about unwelcoming behavior, we will contact the NSS member involved to explain why their behavior was unacceptable, and warn them that a second code of conduct violation will result in us removing them from the NSS community.

This is the protocol that _____ will use to respond to reports of code of conduct violations. 


### Reporting

If you see a violation of our code of conduct, please report it to ________.


#### Why should I report?

* **You are responsible for making the NSS community a safe and comfortable space for everyone. **Everyone in our community shares this responsibility. ______ are not around all the time, so we cannot enforce the code of conduct without your help.

* **The consequences for the NSS community of not reporting bad behavior outweigh the consequences for one person of reporting it. **We sometimes hear “I don't want X person to meeting consequences because I told someone about their bad behavior." Consider the impact on everyone else at RC of letting abusive or unwelcoming behavior continue unchecked.

* The NSS community only works as a self-directed, community-driven community because of the trust shared between NSS cavers. **Reporting code of conduct violations helps us identify when this trust is broken, to prevent that from happening in the future.**



#### Where and how to report

Please report all code of conduct violations using our reporting form. If you would rather discuss the matter in person with _______, email _____ to schedule a time to talk.

In your report, please include:

* **Your name— **this is incredibly helpful for us to be able to follow up with you, and ask questions to better understand the situation. The form allows you to report anonymously. Please only use this option if your really need to, and know that we might not be able to take action without knowing who you are. In any case, provide an email address so we can correspond with you about the report. The third-party reporting tool we're using anonymizes communication, so we never see the email address you provide if you choose to submit anonymously. 


* **A detailed description of what happened**
   * If the violation happened online, please link to or send us the relevant text.
   * If the violation happened in person, please detail what exactly the other person said or did. In order to take action, we need to know the concrete actions that someone took. 
* **Where and when the incident happened**
* **Any other relevant context. **Do you have examples of a pattern of similar behavior from this person before? Do you have a relationship with this person outside of the NSS?
* **If/how you've already responded— **this lets us know the current state of the situation.


### 
Confidentiality

We will keep all reports confidential, except if we've discussed with you and agreed otherwise. When we discuss incidents with people who are reported, we will anonymize details as much as we can to protect reporter privacy. 

However, some incidents happen in one-on-one interactions, and even if the details are anonymized, the reported person may be able to guess who made the report. If you have concerned about retaliation or your personal safety, and do not want us to share the details of your report with anyone (including the perpetrator) please let us know explicitly in your report. Unfortunately, in that situation we will not be able to take any action.

In some cases we may decide to share an update about a major incident with the entire NSS community. If that is the case, the identities of all victims and reporters will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.


### Social rules

In addition to having a code of conduct, we have four lightweight social rules. The social rules are different and separate from the code of conduct. They help us create a better learning environment by giving names to counterproductive behavior and acting as a release valve so that frustration doesn't building up over time. We expect people to unintentionally break the social rules from time to time. Doing this doesn't make you a bad person or a bad caver. When this happens, it is not a big deal. Just apologize and move on.
 
The enforcement provisions in this code of conduct do not apply to the social rules. We definitely won't give you a strong warning or expel you from the NSS community just for breaking a social rule.

If you have any questions about any part of the code of conduct or social rules, please reach out to any _________. 


### How we developed the code of conduct

We arrived at these policies by a combination of:
* Listening to feedback and suggestions we've heard from NSS members over many years
* Reading codes of conducts of other organizations we find to be thoughtful
* Considering how we've handled instances of abusive and unwelcoming behavior in the past


### 
Other things that don't fit into the code of conduct


#### When to seek help immediately

Instead of filling out a code of conduct violation report, please contact law enforcement (call 911) directly to report criminal activity (e.g. physical assault, sexual assault, theft), or to report a dangerous physical situation (e.g. fire, serious injury, fear that someone will hurt themselves or someone else). 

Contact ______ by phone if there are urgent problems with an official NSS event (e.g. if the space is flooding).


#### Getting help

If you or someone else is struggling and needs help, don't hesitate to reach out to _______ in person or over email. We also maintain a list of mental health resources that might be helpful to NSS members.
